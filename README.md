This repository is made to contain code and data related to computer vision, I hope they can be useful to researchers.

# 1- 360 One-Degree Rotations of Base E Image

The folder **E** includes all 360 one-degree rotations of a base image, **E**. The images are organized such that each image represents a single degree of rotation, starting from 0° to 359°, providing a complete 360-degree view of the original base image.

### Base Image

The base image used for these rotations is shown below:

![Base E Image](/E/E_R000.png)

### Folder Structure

- **E**: Contains the 360 rotated versions of the base image, each rotated by 1 degree. The images are named as `E_R000.png`, `E_R001.png`, `E_R002.png`, ..., `E_R359.png`.

These images can be used for various purposes such as calculating and verifying invariant descriptors that are supposed to be resistant to image rotations, or any project requiring a full rotation of a single image.
